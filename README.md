# Résumé Web Template Starter

A minimal, responsive, printable résumé web page starter. Edit `index.html` and `styles.css` to make it your own, then host it statically (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure for résumé sections
- Clean, typography-first design
- Mobile-friendly responsive layout
- Print-friendly CSS (great for PDF export)
- Zero build tools required — just static files

## Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` and replace placeholder content with your details.
2. Adjust typography, colors, and spacing in `styles.css` as desired.
3. Optional: place a profile photo or logos into `assets/img/` and update `index.html` accordingly.

## Print to PDF
- Use the "Print" button in the page or your browser's Print dialog (Ctrl/Cmd+P).
- Ensure margins are set to default/none and background graphics are enabled (varies by browser).

## Deploying
- GitHub Pages: push this repository and enable Pages on the `main` branch root.
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repo; no build step required.
